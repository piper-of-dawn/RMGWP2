    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "HMM is well know statistical model, which reprsents the systmes that undergos transitions between hidden states. Which lead to observable outups from each state. The states $Q$ represents configuration of the systm that are not observable directly. They can only be observed through sympbols from the set $P$, which are the measurable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial State Distribution ($\\Pi$):** This is vector representation of probability of system starting in each hidden states. It is possbility of being in each state at initial time.\n",
    "- **Transition Probability Matrix (A):** It is defined as the probabilities of moving from one state to another. $a_{ij}$ is the probability of transitioning from state $q_i$ to state $q_j$ in the next time step.\n",
    "- **Emission Probability Matrix (B):** Emission Probability matrix is defnied as probability of observing each symbol given the current state. $b_i(s_k)$ is the probability of observing symbol $s_k$ when the system is in state $q_i$.\n",
